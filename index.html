      Water covers 70% of our planet. As human, we tend to think the water is infinite. However, freshwater is only limited in our world.
      Based on the data, only 3% of our water is fresh water that can we use, 97% of it is tucked in glacier and cannot be used.
      Some places in the world probably facing a water scarcity due to their own geographical region, climate change phenomenon, 
      and man-made destruction (ex. groundwater extraction, waste water pollution). <br>
      <b class="water-text">One Water is a campaign to raise awareness about the availability of safe, reliable, and accessible freshwater and drinking water.</b>
