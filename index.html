    <h2>What is it about?</h2>
    <p class="text-edit">
      Water covers 70% of our planet. As human, we tend to think the water is infinite. However, freshwater is only limited in our world.
      Based on the data, only 3% of our water is fresh water that can we use, 97% of it is tucked in glacier and cannot be used.
      Some places in the world probably facing a water scarcity due to their own geographical region, climate change phenomenon, 
      and man-made destruction (ex. groundwater extraction, waste water pollution). <br>
      <b class="water-text">One Water is a campaign to raise awareness about the availability of safe, reliable, and accessible freshwater and drinking water.</b>

    <h2>Water Scarcity</h2>
    <p class="text-edit">Nearly half the global population are already living in potential waterscarce areas at least one month per year 
      and this could increase to some 4.8â€“5.7 billion in 2050. About 73% of the affected people live in Asia (69% by 2050) (Burek et al., 2016).
      Water scarcity explanation according to <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">UN Water</a>: 
      <blockquote cite class="text-edit"="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">
        "Water scarcity can mean scarcity in availability due to physical shortage, or scarcity in access due to the failure of institutions to ensure a regular supply or due to a lack of adequate infrastructure"</blockquote></p>
