        <h2>What is it about?</h2>
        <p>
            Water covers 70% of our planet. As human, we tend to think the water is infinite. However, freshwater is
            only limited in our world.
            Based on the data, only 3% of our water is fresh water that can we use, 97% of it is tucked in glacier and
            cannot be used.
            Some places in the world probably facing a water scarcity due to their own geographical region, climate
            change phenomenon,
            and man-made destruction (ex. groundwater extraction, waste water pollution). <br>
            <b class="water-text">One Water is a campaign to raise awareness about the availability of safe, reliable,
                and accessible freshwater and drinking water.</b>

        <h2>Water Scarcity</h2>
        <p> <img class="water-scarcity" src="assets/Global-Access-to-Water-and-Water-Scarcity-Wells-For-The-World-Inc.jpg"
        alt="Global Water Scarcity"><b class="water-text">Nearly half the global population are already living in potential water scarce areas </b> at least one month per
            year
            and this could increase to some 4.8â€“5.7 billion in 2050. About 73% of the affected people live in Asia (69%
            by 2050) (Burek et al., 2016). <br><br>
            <b class="water-text">Water scarcity explanation according to <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">UN Water</a>:</b>
            "Water scarcity can mean scarcity in availability due to physical shortage, or scarcity in access due to the
            failure of institutions to ensure a regular supply or due to a lack of adequate infrastructure". </p>
